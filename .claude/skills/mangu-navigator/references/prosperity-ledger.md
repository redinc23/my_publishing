# Prosperity ledger — the two scoreboards and how to move them

Prosperity = **Ledger A all-TRUE** (GO declared, v1.0.0 cut) **and** **Ledger B
all-certifiable** (Phoenix North Stars) **while prod never breaks**. Everything
productive maps to a cell below. Snapshot dated 2026-07-20 @ `9a8a940` — always
re-verify state lines with `scripts/state-sync.sh` before quoting them.

## Ledger A — Launch hard gates (authority: `docs/NEXT_GO.md` §6)

All-true rule: any FALSE/PENDING/stale-SHA gate ⇒ NO-GO (CCR-003, CCR-005).

| Gate | Meaning | State @ snapshot | Typical mover |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | main deployment READY on canonical platform | FALSE | Phase 14 deploy dossier (operator) |
| G2 | CI green on the exact release SHA | FALSE (main CI green, but not on a release SHA) | Release-cut CI run |
| G3 | Auth evidence package complete | FALSE | Phase 12 manual QA (real backend) |
| G4 | Purchase → order → library → reading proven | FALSE | Phase 13 Stripe correlation package |
| G5 | RBAC smokes pass | FALSE | Phase 12 RBAC evidence |
| G6 | No false-success public surfaces | FALSE (fixes merged; live QA pending) | Phase 12 live acceptance |
| G7 | `/api/health?ready=1` → `ready:true` in prod | FALSE in doc; **live probe 2026-07-20 returned `ready:true` on www** — gate stays FALSE until evidenced at an exact SHA and appended to the QA log (CCR-002/005). Cheap win: capture that evidence. | Evidence append + Phase 14 confirm |
| G8 | Prod Stripe webhook registered + signed test event | FALSE | Stripe console + evidence |
| G9 | ADR signed; monitors on real prod; DNS canonical | FALSE (ADR ACCEPTED-B; apex DNS still split) | Vercel env + apex DNS cutover |
| G10 | Manual QA rows 1–10 complete | FALSE (rows blank) | Operator QA session |
| G11 | Known-good revision + rehearsed rollback | FALSE | Rollback rehearsal transcript |
| G12 | Baseline refreshed at release SHA | PARTIAL (recurring per CCR-020) | Refresh commit at cut |
| G13 | Authority doc tracked on main | **TRUE** | — |

Supporting backlog: P0-001…P0-020 (issues #186–#205). P0 > P1 > P2, always.

## Ledger B — Phoenix North Stars (authority: `docs/PROJECT_PHOENIX.md` §1.2)

| # | Star | Certify with | State @ snapshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Build integrity | `npm run build` exit 0, zero warnings | Attainable locally; certify at end |
| 2 | Operational health | prod `GET /api/health?ready=1` → `{"ready":true}` | Observed TRUE live 2026-07-20 (Supabase path); needs QA-log evidence, and must hold post-cutover (ties G7) |
| 3 | User confidence | 22-point QA suite in prod (Phoenix §6.1) | Not started (human-run, agent-supported) |
| 4 | Process completion | PRs #1–#6 merged, Vercel prod green | **WS1 merged (#304)**; WS2–WS6 open |
| 5 | Data sovereignty | mongodump stored securely | Human gate, Phase 15 |
| 6 | Clean codebase | `grep -ri "supabase" app/ lib/ components/ types/` → 0 code hits | ~109 files at snapshot (dual-run peak; falls in WS2d/WS4) |
| 7 | User transition | Forced-reset batch executed + telemetry | Script exists (`scripts/request-password-reset.ts`); batch is Phase 11 |
| 8 | Platform hardening | 429s verified, Sentry receiving, logs draining | WS6 |

Workstream order (strict, one PR each): **WS2a → 2b → 2c → 2d → WS3 → WS4 →
WS5 → WS6**, then Phases 11–15 (migration window, mostly human-executed with
agent-written scripts — see `CLAUDE.md` §11 for the six scripts you own).

## Next-best-action, in detail

Evaluate top-down; act on the first true condition:

1. **Prod incident** (probe failure, error spike) → `mangu-ops-runbook`,
   rollback decision tree, QA-log append. Everything else waits.
2. **main CI red** → `mangu-ci-quality`; restore green before any feature PR.
3. **Open agent-actionable security P0** (e.g., H0.1 legacy-anon-key
   consumers still in CI/Vercel config that the agent can edit) → do it now.
4. **Advance the frontier workstream.** After WS1, that's **WS2a**: `lib/mongo`
   query layer + `types/mongo.ts` + `lib/mongo-queries.ts` per `CLAUDE.md` §7,
   provider-gated so Supabase paths keep serving. Then 2b (API routes), 2c
   (server actions + audit), 2d (page swap), WS3, WS4 (the great purge), WS5,
   WS6.
5. **Parallel always-valuable work** when the frontier is review- or
   gate-blocked: WS5 test scaffolding (webhook double-delivery, avg_rating
   recompute), gate-evidence prep (drafting QA matrices, verification
   scripts), doc amendments, HUMAN_TASKS grooming with exact click-paths.
6. **Session close-out:** PR body carries Task IDs + verification output;
   material merges refresh baselines (CCR-020); new blockers land in
   `HUMAN_TASKS.md`; never leave evidence only in chat.

## Verification commands — what counts as proof

Run from repo root. Paste relevant output into PR bodies / QA log.

```bash
# Full local CI parity (quality + unit + build) — required before every PR
./scripts/ci-local.sh

# Individually
npm run type-check          # tsc --noEmit, strict — must be clean
npm run lint
npm test                    # baseline 127/127 across 24 suites; never regress
npm run validate-env        # env schema sanity
npm run build               # North Star #1 when 0 warnings

# North Star #6 burn-down counter (target: 0 after WS4)
grep -rl "supabase" app/ lib/ components/ types/ --include="*.ts*" | wc -l

# Health contract (local dev or prod origin)
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | head -c 400
curl -s "https://www.mangu-publishers.com/api/health?ready=1" | head -c 400

# Mongo bootstrap (human runs with real Atlas keys; you write/maintain)
npm run db:mongo:ping && npm run db:mongo:indexes

# RLS posture (legacy path while Supabase serves prod)
npm run verify-rls

# E2E (needs env/secrets; CI runs preview-e2e otherwise)
npm run test:e2e

# Ops snapshot (probes + open PRs)
./scripts/cowork-status.sh
```

**Evidence rules:** exact-SHA only (CCR-005); append, never rewrite
(CCR-002); no secrets in any pasted output (CCR-009); a green run from a
different SHA proves nothing.
